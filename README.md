# Advice Generating App


## Well, hello there! üëã

This project is a solution for a challenge developed by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). To start the challenge, we receive screenshots of the final product and some guidelines on style and expectations on the usability. The rest was up to me, what is very exciting and mildly terrifying. üôÉ

I particularly enjoy completing these type of challenges as they are a great opportunity to develop my skills in a similar context to real world workflow. Once I was done, I also published it on the Frontend Mentor platform and had the chance to receive feedback from the community. Feel free to visit [my profile at Frontend Mentor]( https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ga-bri-ela). 

## The Challenge 

The [Advice Generating App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) consists in using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to generate a new advice as the user clicks on the button. The number above the advice should also update to match the id number information we receive through the API. 
Another key point from the challenge is creating a responsive application, with compatibility for both desktop and mobile. \

## Technologies üíª

This project was built using JavaScript ES6, Fetch API, CSS and HTML.

## Personal take-aways üë©‚Äçüíª

This was my first project applying Fetch API independently. It has helped me build confidence to take on larger and more complex challenges fetching data. 
This was also my first time applying the CSS media query for different sized screens. As I am very interested in responsive web design, I really appreciate the opportunity to practice the feature. 

## Continued development
This project was one of the first applications I have fully coded independently. I might improve the code in the future with some of the feedback that I have received from the Frontend Mentor community and lessons that I have learned afterwards. Nonetheless, this project has no intent other than serving as a practice project and a steppingstone leading me towards more complex applications. üöÄ
